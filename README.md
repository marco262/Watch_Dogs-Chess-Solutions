Watch_Dogs-Chess-Solutions
==========================

This is my repository that I've made with the intention of sharing all my scripts that attempt to solve Chess puzzles Watch_Dogs.

All scripts were built with and run best on Python 2.7.7 for 64-bit Windows

Scripts:
chess_solution.py: Contains commented out code of my first attempt at a solution. Keeping for historical purposes.
chess_path_solution.py: Built to solve non-Survival chess puzzles. Contains board layouts for all 10 puzzles at <insert location here>
